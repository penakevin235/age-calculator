# age-calculator
This is a code that I came up with after learning to store variables as integers, and doubles, as well as inputting information from user, and outputting information as strings to the console.

It currently is able to tell you your age in years, your age in days, and also in months

I'm currently working to make it a little more precise as far as telling you your age in months, and I want to eventually write in someone's age in minutes, and maybe evn seconds.
